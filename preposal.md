# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- Discord bot fortune teller
- Minecraft mod for talking tools

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I decide to do this alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

After the proposal meeting, am I allowed to change my mind incase if I can't do one or the other?
